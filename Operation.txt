OPERATION:

   Startup:
      From the Enigma splash screen, tap anywhere on the touchscreen to start
      the Enigma simulation.  The simulation begins with the standard M3 Enigma
      (circa 1939) using reflector B, along with the standard III, II, & I
      wheels installed, each with the rings in the default positions, with no
      wires in the plugboard.  To change anything from the default, tap on the
      small Enigma logo at the top-right of the display.  This will take you
      from the Enigma operation screen to the Enigma configuration screen.

   Select the Enigma example setup:
      To select a specific example setup from the Enigma configuration screen,
      tap on the example setup area next to the "Quick Setup" label.  With each
      tap, the selection indicated in the example setup area will advance
      through the list of supported example setups.  When the desired example
      setup is displayed, the entire configuration of that example setup can be
      read in by tapping on the "LOAD" button to the right.  Note that tapping
      the "LOAD" button merely loads the configuration, it does not yet make it
      fully active.

   Enigma machine types:
      The simulation allows selection from the following Enigma Machine types:
         - Standard model Enigma M3 (1939)
         - Standard model Enigma M4 (1942)
         - Business model Enigma D
         - Enigma Rocket K Railway
         - Enigma Swiss K

   Select the Enigma machine type:
      For manual configurations, the machine type can be changed by tapping on
      the machine type area next to the "Machine Type" label.  With each tap,
      the machine type indicated in the machine type area will advance through
      the list of supported machine types.  Note that changing the machine type
      merely changes the selection, it does not yet make it fully active.

   Enigma reflector types:
      Depending upon the Enigma machine type selected, the simulation allows
      selection from the following reflector types:
         - Enigma M3 reflector A
         - Enigma M3 reflector B
         - Enigma M3 reflector C
         - Enigma M4 reflector thin B
         - Enigma M4 reflector thin C
         - Enigma D reflector A
         - Enigma Rocket K Railway reflector A
         - Enigma Swiss K reflector A

   Select the reflector type:
      For manual configurations, the reflector type can be changed by tapping
      on the reflector type area next to the "Reflector" label.  With each tap,
      the reflector type indicated in the reflector type area will advance
      through the list of supported reflector types which are appropropriate
      for the currently selected Enigma machine type.  Note that changing the
      reflector type merely changes the selection, it does not yet make it
      fully active.

   Enigma tape groups:
      The simulation allows selection from the following character groupings
      (the number of characters grouped together, with groups separated by a
      space on the tape display):
         - NONE (all characters contiguous)
         - 3 (groups of 3 characters)
         - 4 (groups of 4 characters)
         - 5 (groups of 5 characters)
         - 6 (groups of 6 characters)

   Select the tape groups:
      The number of characters grouped together (or all characters contiguous)
      on the tape display can be changed by tapping on the tape groups area
      next to the "Tape Groups" label.  With each tap, the tape groups
      indicated in the tape groups area will advance through the list of
      supported tape groups selections.  Note that changing the tape groups
      merely changes the selection, it does not yet make it fully active.

   Enigma wheel types:
      Depending upon the Enigma machine type selected, the simulation allows
      selection from the following wheel types:
         - Enigma M3/M4 wheel I (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma M3/M4 wheel II (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma M3/M4 wheel II (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma M3/M4 wheel IV (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma M3/M4 wheel V (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma M3/M4 wheel VI (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma M3/M4 wheel VII (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma M3/M4 wheel VIII (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma M4 wheel Beta (leftmost slot only)
         - Enigma M4 wheel Gamma (leftmost slot only)
         - Enigma D wheel I (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma D wheel II (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma D wheel III (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma Rocket K Railway wheel I (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma Rocket K Railway wheel II (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma Rocket K Railway wheel III (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma Swiss K wheel I (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma Swiss K wheel II (rightmost 3 slots)
         - Enigma Swiss K wheel III (rightmost 3 slots)

   Select the Enigma wheel types:
      For manual configurations, the wheel types can be changed by tapping on
      the specific wheel position.   With each tap, the Enigma wheel type
      indicated in a particular Enigma wheel type area will advance through
      the list of supported Enigma wheel types which are appropropriate for
      the currently selected Enigma machine type.  Note that changing the
      Enigma wheel type merely changes the selection, it does not yet make it
      fully active.

   Enigma wheel ring settings:
      For each Enigma wheel, the alphabet ring can also be rotated with respect
      to the natural rotor wiring.

   Select the Enigma wheel ring settings:
      The Enigma wheel ring settings can be changed by tapping on the specific
      ring setting area associated with each Enigma wheel type.  With each tap,
      the ring setting indicated in a particular Enigma wheel ring setting area
      will advance through the 26 possible Enigma wheel ring rotations, where a
      ring setting of "01" indicates the natural rotor wiring.  Note that
      changing the Enigma wheel ring settings merely changes the selection, it
      does not yet make it fully active.      

   Enigma plugboard:
      Depending upon the Enigma machine type selected, the simulation allows
      selection of up to 13 plugwires on the plugboard (Stecker), although only
      up to 10 plugwires were used in normal operation.  For each plugwire, a
      pair of letters is selected to simulate plugging the wires in to connect
      the letter pairs.

   Enigma plugwire selection:
      Tapping on any letter in the plugboard area will highlight that letter
      (the first in the pair) in orange.  Tapping on the same highlighted
      letter will cancel its selection (in case it is desired to select a
      different letter as the first in the pair.  With one letter highlighted,
      tapping any other letter (the second in the pair) will complete the
      plugwire pair.  In this case, each letter will be highlighted in purple,
      and each letter will show the other letter of the pair underneath.
      Selecting either letter of a completed pair will cancel that plugwire.
      Note that associating  plugwire pairs merely selects those pairs, it does
      not yet make them fully active.

   Activating configuration selections:
      After all selections are made (Enigma example setups, as well as other
      manual configuration selections), tapping the "ACTIVATE" button will make
      all selections active and return to the Enigma operation screen.  On the
      other hand, tapping the "DISCARD" button will cause all selections to be
      abandoned and the simulation will be returned to the same configuration
      which was active before entering the Enigma configuration screen.

   Enigma wheel setting:
      From the Enigma operation screen, tapping at the bottom of any Enigma
      wheel will advance that wheel by one letter (e.g. tapping at the bottom
      of a wheel currently showing "G" will advance that wheel to show "H").
      Tapping at the top of any Enigma wheel will retard that wheel by one
      letter (e.g. tapping at the top of a wheel currently showing "G" will
      retard that wheel to show "F"). Tapping the top or the bottom of any
      Enigma wheel can be used to set the simulation to the starting condition
      for the Enigma wheels.

   Clearing the tape:
      From the Enigma operation screen, tapping anywhere on the tape output
      will clear the current tape contents.

   Encrypting/decrypting messages:
      Tapping any letter at the bottom of the Enigma operation screen will
      cause the corresponding encrypted/decrypted letter to light in the middle
      of the screen.  As long as the input letter is held, the corresponding
      encrypted/decrypted letter will remain lit as well.  In addition, the
      corresponding encrypted/decrypted letter will also be printed on the
      tape.  And finally, as each Enigma wheel rotates, at the appropriate
      time (depends upon the Enigma wheel type installed in any particular
      position), the advancement of each wheel will cause the wheel to its
      immeidate left to advance one letter for each rotation.
